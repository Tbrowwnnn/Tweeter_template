# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is a twitter clone that was made purely for education purposes only. Styled in a Darth Vader color palette and profile theme, it has the following functionality:

-ability to view tweets on a profile home page. <br>
-submit new tweets with a randomized profile picture, name, and tweet handle after submitted. <br>
-code is using jquery to load tweets asyncronously, therefore there is no need to refresh the page. <br>
-error message that pops up when certain conditions are not met when submitting tweet. <br>
-stylized changes based on mobile and desktop sizes. <br>
-new tweets display time submitted and will update based on time passed. <br>
-tweets have a character counter that will change red when going below character limit. <br>
